# csss-minion

The csss-minion bot is programmed by Henry using the language Python. The bot accepts user input from chat channels and runs a script to execute the command. Commands available include wolframAlpha math functions, grouping users by courses and administrative commands. When invalid input is detected, the bot sends feedback to the user indicating the command does not exist. Valid inputs are processed by the bot and calls the function to execute the specific command. The bot then displays the output to the user of the specified command.
